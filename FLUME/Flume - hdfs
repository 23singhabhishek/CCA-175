Integrate from telnet to HDFS:
-----------------------------
1. For the previous example, instead of logger as the sink have hdfs location as sink.
2. Create a folder 'flume' in /user/cloudera
3. In the conf file, do the following changes
a. In the description for sink, change the type from logger to hdfs
    a1.sinks.k1.type = hdfs

b. Add the additional parameters for customization
    #Customize the sink
    a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.path = /user/cloudera/flume
    a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.filePrefix = netcat
    
    
4. Run the command 
  flume -ng agent -name a1 --conf /user/cloudera/flume/ --conf-file /user/cloudera/flume/eghdfs.conf
  
  
5. Open a new terminal and give the command $ telnet localhost 44444

6. Start typing and hit enter

7. Open another terminal and give the command $ hdfs dfs -ls /user/cloudera/flume/
